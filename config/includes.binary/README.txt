live-miner
==========
Sam Morris <sam@robots.org.uk>

Burn this image to a CD, or write it to a USB stick, and when booted a system
will automatically begin mining bitcoins by using
https://github.com/m0mchil/poclbm[poclbm].

You can find the latest version at http://live-miner.github.com/. If something
doesn't work, https://github.com/live-miner/live-miner/issues[file a bug] or
mailto:sam@robots.org.uk[send me an email].  If you are feeling generous, send
spare BTC to `1MjtnhbdVAL21meEBnhHwfMSovN7kYtrH6`.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration happens in two places:

 1. Boot parameters
 2. Configuration file (`live/live-miner.conf`)

See `live/live-miner.conf` for the list of options specific to live-miner, and
their corresponding boot parameters. In order to escape spaces in boot
parameters, use octal. For instance:

----
live-miner.urls=http://user:pass@host0:port\040http://user:pass@host1:port
----

Values from boot parameters override values from the file. Whether you use the
boot parameters or the configuration file will depend on how you choose to boot
live-miner.

See the man pages for
http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=live-boot&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=Debian+testing+wheezy&format=html&locale=en[live-boot]
and
http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=live-config&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=Debian+testing+wheezy&format=html&locale=en[live-config]
for more boot parameters.

USB stick
~~~~~~~~~

Write `binary.img` to your USB stick. On Linux, you can do something like this:

----
dd if=binary.img of=/dev/sdX
----

This will erase anything already on the device, so make sure you aren't
accidentally overwriting your hard disk! On Windows you can use a program such
as https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer[Image Writer for Windows].

Once the image is written, remove and re-insert the USB stick. You should now
be able to edit `live/live-miner.conf`. Once you have done so, boot from the
USB stick and your computer should begin mining.

CD/DVD
~~~~~~

While `binary.iso` can be written to a CD and booted without any further
changes, you will have to do your configuration at the boot menu. To do so,
press the Tab key during the 5-second boot countdown, and then append boot
parameters to the list that appears. Press Enter to actually boot.

If you will be rebooting often, or have several computers to configure, you can
avoid the inconvenience of manual configuration by remastering the CD with an
edited `live/live-miner.conf`, or by booting with a different method.

Network
~~~~~~~

The netboot archive contains two directories: `debian-live`, the contents of
which should be shared over NFS; and `tftpboot`, the contents of which should
be available via TFTP. Setting this up requires some co-ordination between your
DHCP, TFTP and NFS servers. I use the same machine running Debian for all
three, on `10.0.0.1`. My setup is something like the following:

Install `isc-dhcp-server` and put the following in `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`:

----
subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
    range 10.0.1.1 10.0.1.254;
    option routers 10.0.0.1;
    option domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1;
    filename "pxelinux.0";
    next-server 10.0.0.1;
}
----

Install `tftpd-hdpa` and move the contents of `tftpboot` to `/srv/tftp`. Modify
`/srv/tftp/live.cfg` to look like this:

----
label live-miner
menu label ^live-miner
kernel /live/vmlinuz
append initrd=/live/initrd.img boot=live config quiet netboot=nfs nfsroot=10.0.0.1:/srv/live-miner
----

Move the contents of `debian-live` to `/srv/live-miner`. Edit
`/srv/live-miner/live/live-miner.conf` to configure your server URLs and miner
options. Install `nfs-kernel-server` and export that directory via NFS by
adding the following to `/etc/exports`:

----
/srv/live-miner 10.0.0.0/16(ro,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
----

Run `exportfs -r` after editing `/etc/exports`. Finally, configure your
machines for network booting in their BIOS, and reboot them!

Overriding xorg.conf
--------------------

During boot, live-miner will look for AMD graphics cards and write out an
`/etc/X11/xorg.conf` that combines them all into one `ServerLayout` section.

If you provide `live/xorg.conf` on the live medium, it will be used instead of
the autogenerated file. An example config file is provided at
`live/xorg.conf.example`.

Building your own image
-----------------------

Most of the heavy lifting is done by the excellent tools provided by the
http://live.debian.net/[Debian Live project]. I'm building the images on a
Debian wheezy system, but any reasonably modern Linux system with
http://live.debian.net/manual-3.x/html/live-manual/installation.en.html#121[live-build]
3.0 installed should work.

After installing `live-build`, `make`, 'asciidoc' and `git`:

----
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/live-miner/live-miner.git
$ cd live-miner
$ make
----

This will build three images (in `output/{hdd,iso,netboot}`) and collect the
source archives in `output/source`. Unless you really want all three and/or are
planning on distributing your built image to a third party, you can save time
by building just what you want: run `make output/stamp-hdd`, `make
output/stamp-iso` or `make output/netboot` instead.

*Important legal stuff*: If you are going to distribute the images you build
then be sure to do the full build of all three binary images, plus the source
archives. If you distribute a binary image to a third party, you must also
(offer to) give them the source archives as well. This is necessary because
live-miner contains materials licensed under the GPL (and similar licenses).

FAQ
---

[quanda]
How do I use this crazy GUI?::
	Press the Windows key + an arrow key to move between windows.
Win+Shift+arrow will move a window around on the screen. Win+Enter will
fire up a new terminal. See the http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html[i3 User's
Guide] for the full details, and the http://i3wm.org/docs/refcard.html[i3
Reference Card] for quick reference.

TODO
----

Run processes within http://tmux.sourceforge.net/[tmux] and provide
`openssh-server` to make remote monitoring easier.
